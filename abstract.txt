# Polynomial time kernel reductions among equivalence problems #

Jeffrey Finkelstein and Ben Hescott

In this talk, we consider complexity considerations for a recently introduced
type of reduction which applies solely to problems of equivalence or
isomorphism: the "kernel reduction". Specifically, we examine reductions among
languages in the complexity class consisting of all languages induced by
equivalence relations for which membership can be decided by a
non-deterministic polynomial time Turing machine. This class is called "NPEq";
the definitions for PEq and coNPEq are analagous. The obvious questions which
drive this work are "What is the power of polynomial time kernel reductions in
NPEq?", and "Are there problems which are complete for NPEq under polynomial
time kernel reductions?".

We prove a general theorem which provides a problem which is hard under
polynomial time kernel reductions for several classes of equivalence relations,
including (Sigma_k)PEq and PSPACEEq. In fact, such a problem seems to be
complete for PSPACEEq under polynomial time kernel reductions. We also show
that if there is a complete problem under kernel reductions in NPEq, then that
problem is also complete under many-one reductions in NP. Finally we use a
proof of Ladner's theorem to show that if PEq does not equal NPEq and there are
problems in NPEq which are complete under polynomial time kernel reductions
then there are NPEq-intermediary problems---problems which are in NPEq, but not
complete under kernel reductions and not in PEq.
