# In no particular order #

* - natural \\(\mathsf{PSPACEEq}\\)-complete problems? (Garey and Johnson lists
  several \\(\mathsf{PSPACE}\\)-complete problems of inequivalence)
* - do complexity results for boolean formulae, boolean circuits, polynomials,
  other structures translate to the setting of kernel reductions?
* - \\(\leq\_{ker}\\)-hard problems for lower complexity classes? higher?
* - \\(\mathsf{NPEq}\\)- and \\(\mathsf{PEq}\\)-complete problems? (polynomial
  time kernel reductions in \\(\mathsf{PEq}\\) may still be meaningful because
  of "density" of equivalence classes)
